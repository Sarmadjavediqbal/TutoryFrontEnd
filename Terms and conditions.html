Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Tutory may assign or transfer these Terms, at its sole discretion, without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.<br><br>
                                    33.	<h2>Force Majeure</h2><br><br>
                                    4.	Tutory is not liable for any failure or delay of performance (or otherwise) arising out of a cause beyond Tutory’s reasonable control.<br><br>
                                    34.	<h2>No Waiver</h2><br><br>
                                    5.	A delay or omission by Tutory to exercise any right or power under the Terms will not be construed to be a waiver thereof.<br><br>
                                    35.	<h2>Notices</h2><br><br>
                                    6.	Any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be in writing and given by Tutory (i) via email (in each case to the address that you provide) or (ii) by posting to the Site or via the Application. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.<br><br>
                                    36.	<h2>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2><br><br>
                                    7.	These Terms and your use of the Services will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of India. You and we agree to submit any dispute arising under these Terms to the personal jurisdiction of a court located in Bangalore for any actions for which the parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.<br><br>
                                    37.	<h2>General</h2><br><br>
                                    1.	The failure of Tutory to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Tutory. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.<br><br>
